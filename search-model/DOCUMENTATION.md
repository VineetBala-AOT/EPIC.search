# Model Hosting and Production Guidelines

This document provides guidance on hosting language models for production use in the search application.

## Model Configuration

### Model Selection
When deploying the search model, you can configure which model to use through Docker build arguments:
- `MODEL_NAME`: The base model name (e.g., `qwen2.5`, `llama2`)
- `MODEL_VERSION`: The model version/size (e.g., `0.5b`, `3b`, `7b`)

Example build command:
```bash
docker build -t search-model \
    --build-arg MODEL_NAME=qwen2.5 \
    --build-arg MODEL_VERSION=3b \
    .
```

## Model Hosting Options

### Cloud-Based Solutions

1. **Azure Machine Learning**
   - Managed endpoints with autoscaling
   - Built-in monitoring and metrics
   - Integration with Azure security features

2. **Azure Container Instances**
   - Suitable for moderate workloads
   - Cost-effective for predictable loads
   - Easy deployment and management

3. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
   - Highly scalable
   - Suitable for large-scale deployments
   - Complex but flexible orchestration

### Self-Hosted Solutions

1. **Dedicated VM Deployment**
   - Full control over hardware resources
   - Suitable for consistent workloads
   - Custom optimization possibilities

2. **OLLAMA**
   - Lightweight and efficient
   - Easy to set up and manage
   - Good for moderate workloads
   - Can be hosted on local hardware or VMs

## Hardware Requirements

### General Guidelines

- Minimum 16GB RAM for production workloads
- SSD storage for model files
- GPU acceleration recommended for higher throughput

### Model-Specific Requirements

Different model sizes have different resource requirements:

- Small models (0.5b-1b parameters):
  - 8GB+ RAM
  - 4+ CPU cores
  - Entry-level GPU optional

- Medium models (3b-7b parameters):
  - 16GB+ RAM
  - 8+ CPU cores
  - Mid-range GPU recommended

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Implement health checks
- Monitor:
  - Response times
  - Memory usage
  - GPU utilization
  - Request queue length
- Set up alerts for resource thresholds
- Regular model updates and validation

## Security Considerations

- Network isolation
- API authentication
- Regular security updates
- Model input validation
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection

## Cost Optimization

- Consider batch processing where applicable
- Implement caching strategies
- Use auto-scaling based on demand
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Consider hybrid approaches (cloud + self-hosted)

## Best Practices

1. **High Availability**
   - Deploy across multiple zones/regions
   - Implement failover mechanisms
   - Use load balancing

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize model loading
   - Implement request queuing
   - Use appropriate batch sizes
   - Cache frequent requests

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular backups
   - Scheduled updates
   - Performance monitoring
   - Load testing

4. **Scaling**
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Auto-scaling policies
   - Resource limits and quotas
