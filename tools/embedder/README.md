```bash
cd src/database
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run as a Python Application

You can run the embedder as a standard Python application:

```powershell
# Process a specific project
python main.py --project_id <project_id>

# Process all available projects
python main.py

# Skip creation of HNSW vector indexes (faster startup, less resource usage)
python main.py --skip-hnsw-indexes

# Combine with other options
python main.py --project_id <project_id> --skip-hnsw-indexes

# Retry documents that previously failed processing
python main.py --retry-failed

# Retry documents that were previously skipped (unsupported formats, missing OCR)
python main.py --retry-skipped

# Retry failed/skipped documents for specific project(s)
python main.py --retry-failed --project_id <project_id>
python main.py --retry-skipped --project_id <project_id>

# Shallow mode: process limited number of documents per project
python main.py --shallow 10 --project_id <project_id>
python main.py --retry-failed --shallow 5

# Timed mode: run for a specific time period then gracefully stop
python main.py --timed 60  # Run for 60 minutes
python main.py --timed 30 --project_id <project_id>  # 30 minutes for specific project

# Combine timed mode with other options
python main.py --timed 120 --shallow 10  # 2 hours with shallow limit
python main.py --timed 45 --retry-failed  # 45 minutes retrying failed documents

# High-performance server runs with optimized settings
# Configure concurrency based on your hardware resources
python main.py --project_id <project_id>

# Example: 32-core server with manual settings
FILES_CONCURRENCY_SIZE=16 KEYWORD_EXTRACTION_WORKERS=2 python main.py

# Background processing with nohup (server deployment)
nohup python -u main.py --project_id <project_id> > output.log 2>&1 &
```

### Run as a Docker Container

You can build and run the embedder as a Docker container with several different configuration approaches:

#### Option 1: Standard Build (Models downloaded at runtime)

With this approach, both models will be downloaded when first needed during processing:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t epic-search-embedder .

# Run the container with environment variables
docker run --env-file .env epic-search-embedder
```

#### Option 2: Preloaded Models Build (Models embedded in image)

For faster startup in production environments, you can preload one or both models into the Docker image:

```bash
# Build with both models preloaded (same model for both)
docker build -t epic-search-embedder \
  --build-arg PRELOAD_EMBEDDING_MODEL="all-mpnet-base-v2" \
  --build-arg PRELOAD_KEYWORD_MODEL="all-mpnet-base-v2" .

# Or build with different models for embedding and keyword extraction
docker build -t epic-search-embedder \
  --build-arg PRELOAD_EMBEDDING_MODEL="all-mpnet-base-v2" \
  --build-arg PRELOAD_KEYWORD_MODEL="distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens" .
```

The preloaded model approach is recommended for production deployments as it eliminates the download delay when containers start.

## Overview

The Embedder performs the following operations:

- Retrieves documents from S3 storage
- **Validates PDF content** and processes scanned/image-based documents with OCR
- Converts PDF content to searchable text using standard extraction or Tesseract OCR
- Splits documents into manageable chunks
- Creates vector embeddings for each chunk
- Stores embeddings in a vector database with rich metadata (including S3 keys)
- Extracts and indexes document tags and keywords (5 per chunk for focused results)
- Stores complete project metadata as JSONB for analytics
- **Comprehensive failure tracking**: Captures complete document metadata (PDF title, author, creator, creation date, page count, file size) even for failed processing
- Tracks processing status and detailed metrics for each document
- **OCR Support**: Automatically detects and processes scanned PDFs using Tesseract OCR when available

## Architecture

The Embedder follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Main Processor (`main.py`)**: Entry point and workflow orchestrator
- **Processor Service (`processor.py`)**: Manages parallel document processing
- **Loader Service (`loader.py`)**: Handles document loading and embedding
- **Logger Service (`logger.py`)**: Tracks document processing status

For detailed technical documentation, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Monitoring

### Progress Tracking

The embedder includes automated progress tracking that provides real-time summaries during processing. Progress summaries are automatically printed every 30 seconds, showing:

- **Runtime and ETA**: Current elapsed time and estimated completion time
- **Project Progress**: Number of projects completed vs. total
- **Document Progress**: Documents processed, failed, and skipped with percentages
- **Processing Rate**: Documents per hour throughput
- **Data Throughput**: Pages per hour and MB per hour processing rates
- **Active Workers**: Currently processing documents with worker IDs, page counts, and file sizes
- **Current Project**: Name of the project being processed

```

### Progress Analysis

The progress tracker provides valuable insights for optimization:

- **Rate Analysis**: Documents/hour helps identify performance bottlenecks
- **Worker Utilization**: Active worker count shows concurrency effectiveness
- **ETA Accuracy**: Estimated completion time improves throughout processing
- **Failure Patterns**: Failed/skipped ratios help identify problematic document types

Processing progress is logged to the console during execution. Each document's processing status is also recorded in the database with comprehensive metrics.

### Enhanced Failure Analysis

The system captures detailed document metadata even for failed processing attempts, including:

- Complete PDF metadata (title, author, creator, creation date, format info)
- Page count and file size
- Validation status and specific failure reasons (e.g., scanned PDFs detected by content/producer analysis, corrupted files)
- Full exception details for runtime errors

This enables detailed analysis of processing patterns and identification of problematic document types.

For detailed troubleshooting, check the console output for error messages, which include specific document IDs and failure reasons. Query the `processing_logs` table for comprehensive failure analytics.

## Troubleshooting

### OCR Issues

#### Tesseract Not Found

```text
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Install Tesseract**: Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
2. **Add to PATH**: Ensure Tesseract is in your system PATH
3. **Set explicit path**: Use `TESSERACT_PATH` environment variable:

   ```env
   TESSERACT_PATH=C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
   ```

#### Azure Document Intelligence Errors

```text
azure.core.exceptions.ClientAuthenticationError: Invalid API key
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify credentials**: Check endpoint URL and API key in Azure Portal
2. **Check resource status**: Ensure Document Intelligence resource is active
3. **Validate region**: Endpoint URL should match your resource region

#### OCR Quality Issues

- **Poor text quality**: Increase `OCR_DPI` (e.g., 400-600 for high-quality scans)
- **Wrong language**: Set `OCR_LANGUAGE` to correct language code
- **Complex layouts**: Consider switching to Azure Document Intelligence for better layout understanding

### Known Issues

#### ProcessPoolExecutor Shutdown Error

You may occasionally see this error when the application exits:

```code
Exception ignored in: <function _ExecutorManagerThread.__init__.<locals>.weakref_cb at 0x...>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\Lib\concurrent\futures\process.py", line 310, in weakref_cb
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'util'
```

This is a harmless error related to Python's multiprocessing module during interpreter shutdown and can be safely ignored. This error has been suppressed in the application but may still appear in certain environments.

#### Database Connection Issues on Servers

If you encounter SSL SYSCALL errors or connection timeouts when running on Ubuntu servers:

```text
(psycopg.OperationalError) consuming input failed: SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected
```

This indicates database connection issues during bulk operations. The application now includes:

- **Batched chunk insertions** - Large documents are split into smaller database transactions
- **Connection retry logic** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for connection failures  
- **Improved connection pooling** - Better connection management and timeouts
- **Configurable batch sizes** - Adjust `CHUNK_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable (default: 50)

To resolve persistent connection issues:

1. Reduce batch size: `CHUNK_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE=25`
2. Check database connection stability
3. Ensure adequate database connection limits
4. Verify network connectivity between application and database

### Retrying Failed or Skipped Documents

If documents failed processing or were skipped (e.g., due to missing OCR), you can reprocess them using retry flags:

#### Retry Failed Documents

```bash
# Retry all failed documents across all projects
python main.py --retry-failed

# Retry failed documents for specific project(s)
python main.py --retry-failed --project_id <project_id>

# Retry failed documents with limited processing per project
python main.py --retry-failed --shallow 10
```

Use `--retry-failed` when:

- OCR processing was failing but is now working
- Database connection issues have been resolved
- Model loading or embedding generation was failing

#### Retry Skipped Documents

```bash
# Retry all skipped documents across all projects
python main.py --retry-skipped

# Retry skipped documents for specific project(s)
python main.py --retry-skipped --project_id <project_id>
```

Use `--retry-skipped` when:

- OCR was not available but is now enabled/configured
- Previously unsupported document formats are now supported
- Documents were skipped due to validation issues that have been fixed

> **Note**: You cannot use `--retry-failed` and `--retry-skipped` together. Choose the appropriate retry mode based on the status of documents you want to reprocess.

### Timed Mode Processing

For scheduled processing windows or resource-constrained environments, use timed mode to run processing for a specific duration:

```bash
# Run for 2 hours then gracefully stop
python main.py --timed 120

# Process specific project for 30 minutes
python main.py --timed 30 --project_id <project_id>

# Combine with other modes
python main.py --timed 60 --shallow 10  # 1 hour with shallow processing
python main.py --timed 45 --retry-failed  # 45 minutes retrying failed documents
```

**Timed Mode Behavior:**

- Gracefully stops after the specified time limit
- Completes any documents currently being processed
- Does not start new projects or fetch new document batches after time limit
- Provides elapsed and remaining time updates during processing
- Perfect for scheduled maintenance windows or batch processing jobs

**Use Cases:**

- Scheduled overnight processing windows
- Resource-limited environments with time constraints  
- Batch processing jobs with SLA requirements
- Testing and development with controlled run times

## Development

### Running Tests

Run unit tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

### Preloading Models Manually

For testing purposes, you can manually preload the embedding models:

```bash
# Set the model names
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME="all-mpnet-base-v2"
export KEYWORD_MODEL_NAME="all-mpnet-base-v2"

# Run the preloader
python preload_models.py
```
