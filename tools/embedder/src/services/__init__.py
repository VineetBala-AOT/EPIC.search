Services Package for Document Processing and Embedding.

This package contains the core service modules that handle document processing,
text extraction, vector embedding generation, and data storage operations.
Each service module focuses on a specific aspect of the document processing pipeline,
from loading files to embedding text and storing vectors.

The package includes OCR capabilities for processing scanned PDF documents
using configurable providers (Tesseract local or Azure Document Intelligence).
