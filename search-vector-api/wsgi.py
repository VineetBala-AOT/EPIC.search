"""WSGI entrypoint for the Vector Search API application.

This module serves as the production entry point for WSGI servers 
(like Gunicorn) to run the Flask application. It configures the
Python path to include the src directory and initializes the app.

Usage:
    - For development: python wsgi.py
    - For production: gunicorn wsgi:application
