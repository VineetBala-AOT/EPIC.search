"""API blueprint and namespace initialization for the Vector Search API.

This module defines and configures the Flask blueprints and API namespaces that form
the REST API structure of the application. It organizes endpoints into logical groups:

1. Main API Blueprint (/api/*)
   - Vector search endpoints for searching documents

2. Health Blueprint (/*)
   - Operational health endpoints for monitoring and status checks

The module uses Flask-RESTx namespaces to maintain separation of concerns between
different API resources while providing consistent documentation through Swagger.
