"""API endpoints for vector and keyword-based document search operations.

This module provides REST API endpoints for searching documents using multiple search strategies:
1. Semantic vector search using document embeddings for meaning-based matches
2. Keyword-based search for traditional text matching  
3. Document similarity search using document-level embeddings
4. Two-stage search combining document-level filtering with chunk retrieval

The implementation uses Flask-RESTx for API definition with Swagger documentation,
Marshmallow for request validation, and delegates search logic to the SearchService.
Results include both matched documents and detailed performance metrics for each
search stage in the pipeline.

Database Structure:
- documents table: Contains document-level metadata (keywords, tags, headings, embeddings)
- document_chunks table: Contains text chunks with embeddings for semantic search

        Stage 0: Project Inference (when no project IDs provided)
        - Automatically detects project references in natural language queries
        - Applies project filtering when highly confident (>80% threshold)
        - Removes identified project names from search terms to focus on actual topics
        
        Stage 1: Document Discovery
        - Searches the documents table using pre-computed keywords, tags, and headings
        - Identifies the most relevant documents based on metadata matching
        - Much faster than searching all chunks directly
        
        Stage 2: Chunk Retrieval  
        - Performs semantic vector search within chunks of relevant documents
        - Uses embeddings to find the most semantically similar content
        - Returns the best matching chunks from promising documents
        
        Fallback Strategy:
        - If no relevant documents found in Stage 1, searches all chunks
        - Ensures comprehensive coverage even for edge cases
        
        The pipeline also includes cross-encoder re-ranking for optimal relevance.
