"""API endpoints for managing search operations with vector-based similarity and keyword-based search.

This module provides REST API endpoints for searching documents using semantic vector search,
keyword-based search, or a combination of both (hybrid search). It utilizes embeddings
generated from sentence transformers and PostgreSQL with pgvector extension.
