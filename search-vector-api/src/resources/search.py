"""API endpoints for vector and keyword-based document search operations.

This module provides REST API endpoints for searching documents using multiple search strategies:
1. Semantic vector search using document embeddings for meaning-based matches
2. Keyword-based search for traditional text matching
3. Hybrid search combining both approaches for optimal results

The implementation uses Flask-RESTx for API definition with Swagger documentation,
Marshmallow for request validation, and delegates search logic to the SearchService.
Results include both matched documents and detailed performance metrics for each
search stage in the pipeline.
